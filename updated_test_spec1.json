Strict conformity to 'General Requirement' and 'Directive Composition' protocols is essential for efficiently designing these directives.\n\n[General Requirement]\n1. Every directive must be in English (with its Chinese translation in brackets attached).\n2. Directives should be crafted in a conversation-like vernacular, akin to that used in voice recognition systems. This style eschews the use of punctuation and incorporates filler words such as \"um\" and \"ah\". It encourages a casual manner of speaking.\n\n[Directive Composition]\nundefined\n\n[Directive Creation Guidelines]\nundefined\n\n[Note about What You Shall Generate]\n1. Please pay heed to these rectified guidelines when crafting pertinent test directives. This will ensure clarity and conformity in instruction generation for the application.\n2. No preamble is necessary.",

The parameters to be included are: APP search for an IM message, group chat/private chat, corresponding conversation, sender, time message was sent, message data type, main body of the message, message length (only for text messages), whether the message has been read or not, whether there's a reply to the message or not, whether the message is pinned or not, whether it's favorited or not, and whether I am mentioned in the message or not.\n2. Decompose each directive into different elements: primary command (content), private chat or group chat, as well as mandatory examination of the application in use.\n3. Each directive must mandatorily include the application and search content.\n4. The content of the search can be vague or specific. For instance, 'Find out the number of messages that I did not respond to that Peter sent me over Whatsapp last weekend' is an example of being clear; 'Find the content related to electric vehicles that Zhang San chatted with me about on WhatsApp last week' is an example of being vague.\n5. Combinatorial creations are a must.\n6. The private chat could be a private chat with one person, or several people. You may view one group chat, or multiple group chats. This could be made vague or specific, or without specifying a sender.\n7. The command may specify the sender's sending time, e.g. to view messages from last week. The sending time can be vague, clear, or without a specified time.\n8. The data type of the message can be a picture or may not have a specific type.\n9. The main content of the message can be unclear, clear, or there may be no main body of the message.\n10. The search message content can specify length, e.g. find those messages exceeding one hundred characters. You also don't have to specify length.\n11. You can specify if the information to search is read or unread, or you don't have to specify.\n12. You can also specify if the message is replied to.\n13. You can specify if the message is pinned.\n14. You can specify if the message is favorited and if I am mentioned.",

During the testing process, based on your baseline knowledge, identify the various combinations you need to test. Arrange these combinations into groups, with each group containing three directives. \n3. Assign a secondary title to each group, which succinctly describes the principal characteristics of that group.\n3.1 Please provide a Chinese translation for each group title and include it in parenthesis."
